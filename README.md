I select my data and insert a pivot table in the new worksheet. From pivot table fields, I dragged department to rows and salary to values. From the value field settings, I changed 'count of salary' to 'average of salary' and then go to number format to set it as currency. While trying to change it to average of salary we faced an "#div/0!".  I solved the issue by changing the dalary data by cleaning. I did this by clicking on the header of the salary column and then by using text to column, selecting delimited, unchecking all delimiters, then clicking finish. Then I formatted the salary column as numbers. Now I go back to the pivot table to refresh it and find that the error is gone. The average salary per department is shown below.

I calculated the average salary per department via the averageif function after inserting a new column beside salary column and naming it as 'AVG dept salary'.Then I inserted another column called salary class beside the newly created column in column H. In H2 I entered a formula to depict those employees as high class who have their salary higher than the avg dept salary of their respective dept. The image below shows the high class employees

I selected the data (years Experience and Salary columns) and then went to the insert tab to select the scatter chart from the chart icon. The scattered chart that appeared shows a positive relation. Then I clicked on the chart and chart elements option appear after clicking on the plus sign. Then I chose trendline and then selected 'display equation on chart' and 'display R squared value on chart' from 'more options'. As a result the value of R square appears on the chart and since the value is very small and closer to 0, it indicates a weak relationship. This means salary is increased slightly due to years of experience but there are other factors in the dataset which have a stronger influence on the salary.

We need to figure out if employees with higher years of experince are earning better than those with lower years of experience. I clicked on a cell in my data and then chose insert pivot table from the insert ribbon and then I dragged experience tier field to Rows and salary field to values. I used value field settings on salary to change it to 'average of salary' from 'sum of salary' and chose currency from number format. The following image shows that employees with more years of experience do not consistently earn a higher average salary compared to employees with fewer years of experience. Because in the data it is seen that even though employees with high experience have the highest average salary, the employees with low experience earn a higher average salary than those with medium experience.

Then I mooved to the sheet with the pivot table and dragged the department field to rows section and salary field to values section.

Lastly, I clicked on one of the cells in the column with sum of salary and then right clicked and selected 'sort' from the popup.
